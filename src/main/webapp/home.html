							<dt>Night Prayer</dt>
							<dd>Eternal Father, I desire to rest in Thy Heart this night. I make the <em> intention </em> of offering to Thee every beat of my heart, joining to them as many acts of love and desire. I pray that even while I am asleep, I will bring back to Thee souls that offend Thee. I ask forgiveness for the whole world, especially for those who know Thee and yet sin. I offer to Thee my every breath and heartbeat as a prayer of reparation. Amen.</dd>
