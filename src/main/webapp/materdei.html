<blockquote>
"the mother of my  Lord" <footer>by Elizabeth in the visitation scene (Lk 1:43)</footer>
</blockquote>
<br>
With deeper reflection on what is meant for Mary to be Mother of the Lord  by early church fathers like Clement of Alexandria, Jerome, Ambrose and Augustine,  there arose a  deeper understanding of Mary being associated with Christ's royal lordship. It was Origen  who made a significant " first step forward " along these lines by referring to Mary as <em>"kuria"</em> in his commentary on this passage. Origen viewed Elizabeth's greeting Mary with the words "mother of my Lord" as honoring her with a royal dignity.
Similarly, Saint Ephrem referred to Mary as <em>" the Most Holy Sovereign Lady(Domina),</em> Mother of God." Jerome and Augustine also spoke of Mary's sovereignty.
"Mary as the mother of the King"
<br>

Luke portrays Mary as giving birth to the eternal, messiah King and Lord, we can deduce from these texts that Mary's unique association with such a royal Son implies that she, too, possesses a royal status
<br>

Theological deduction from  Genesis 3:15, links Mary to her Son's victory .And in the Annunciation Mary's spousal like relationship with the Holy Spirit and because of her intimate union with her Davidic Son, she must have a share in Christ's royal privileges.
<br>

In the Old Testament, the Queen was often not the wife of the King, but the Mother.
Biblical texts in 1 and 2 Kings and in the Book of Jeremiah show that in the kingdom of Judah, the queen mother held an official position as queen, participating in her son's reign by serving as an advocate for the people and as a counselor to her son. It is commonly noted how Bathsheba gained considerable power when she became queen mother after her son Solomon assumed the throne. King Solomon honors his queen mother by bowing before her, having her sit at his right hand and saying he will grant her any request she makes. Some scholars also demonstrate how the queen - mother figure plays an important role in two passages from Israel's tradition, which eventually became associated to some extent with the messiah:Isaiah 7:14 and Genesis 3:15 closely associate a royal mother with her royal son and his work.
<br>

The Hebrew word is <mark>"gebiran"</mark> meaning "great lady" which Mary most certainly was. There are references in the Old Testament to the Queen Mother. 1 Kings 15:13,
<br>

Then King Jehoiakim, along with his advisers, nobles, and officials, and the queen mother, surrendered to the Babylonians."  (2 Kings 24:12)

<br>
  
In the New Testament, Mary and Jesus are shown as fulfilling Isaiah 7:14;Lk 1:26-31, thus connecting Mary with the queen-mother concept.
<br>

On the third day there was a wedding at Cana ....When the wine ran out, the mother of Jesus said to him, "They have no wine."And Jesus said to her, "Woman, what does this have to do with me? My hour has not yet come."His mother said to the servants, "Do whatever he tells you." (2 Jn 1-5) - Jesus then changed the water into wine, at his mother's request.
<br>

Theotokos
Mary did not create the divine person of Jesus, who existed with the Father from all eternity. "In fact, the One whom she conceived as man by the Holy Spirit, who truly became her Son according to the flesh, was none other than the Father's eternal Son, the second person of the Holy Trinity. Hence the Church confesses that Mary is truly <em>'Mother of God' (Theotokos)"</em> (CCC, No. 495).
<br>

 As St. John wrote, "The Word became flesh and made His dwelling among us, and we have seen His glory: The glory of an only Son coming from the Father filled with enduring love" (Jn 1:14).
<br>

St. John Chrysostom (d. 407), for example, composed in his Eucharistic Prayer for the Mass an anthem in honor of her: "It is truly just to proclaim you blessed, O Mother of God, who are most blessed, all pure and Mother of our God. We magnify you who are more honorable than the Cherubim and incomparably more glorious than the Seraphim. You who, without losing your virginity, gave birth to the Word of God. You who are truly the Mother of God."
<br>

On June 22, 431, <mark>the Council of Ephesus </mark> declared, "If anyone does not confess that the Emmanuel is truly God and therefore that the holy Virgin is the Mother of God (Theotokos) (since she begot according to the flesh the Word of God made flesh), anathema sit." Therefore, the Council officially recognized that Jesus is one person, with two natures--human and divine--united in a true union. Second, Ephesus affirmed that our Blessed Mother can rightfully be called the Mother of God. Mary is not Mother of God, the Father, or Mother of God, the Holy Spirit; rather, she is Mother of God, the Son--Jesus Christ.
<br>

How could she but be powerful, she who merits the triple title: Domini Filia, Domini Mater, Domini Sponsa, Daughter of God, Mother of God and Spouse of God.

<mark>Mary- New Ark of the Covenant</mark><br>
Rev chapter 12<br>
12 :1 A great portent appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars. 2 She was pregnant and was crying out in birth pangs, in the agony of giving birth. Then the dragon stood before the woman who was about to bear a child, so that he might devour her child as soon as it was born. 5 And she gave birth to a son, a male child, who is to rule all the nations with a rod of iron. But her child was snatched away and taken to God and to his throne..
Jesus only had one Mother and this passage is talking about the woman that gave birth to the Saviour. She has a Crown. The passage also clearly shows Mary as an active participant in the war against the devil. The Passage presents Jesus on his rightful throne.
<br>

The Ark of the Old Covenant carried the Word of God made stone while the Ark of the New Covenant carried the Word of God made flesh when Mary was pregnant with Jesus.


The old Ark of the Covenant disappears in Jer 3:16. The new Ark of the Covenant resurfaces in Revelation 11:19 as the woman with a crown of 12 stars around her head.


The Ark of the Covenant has been restored to the temple, which is now heaven (See also Heb 9:1-12)
<br>

A woman with a crown is there - the new Ark

The woman in Revelation gave birth to the King of the Israelites (Jesus) - who will rule the nations and is on God's throne

The devil is very interested in destroying her but she is safe
Her children are all faithful Christians who "follow the lamb" (Rev 12:17)
<br>

All the faithful will be given crowns (1 Pt 5:4, Rev 2:10, 2 TIm 2:11-12, 2 Tim 4:7-8) How much more would Mary, his mother, receive the crown as Queen?

<mark>Quotes from  Doctors of the Church  regarding the Mother of God:</mark>
<br>
<mark>
St. Ephraem</mark>
Mary is the most marvelous creature who exist, after Jesus. Only you (Jesus) and your Mother are more beautiful than everything. For on you, O Lord, there is no mark; neither is there any stain in your Mother.
<br>
<mark>
St John Chrysostom</mark>
In case a Jew should ask you how the Virgin could give birth, answer him thus: How could a virgin soil make wondrous plants spring up? For, in the Hebrew, "Eden" means virgin soil. A virgin drove us out of paradise; through a Virgin we have found eternal life.
<br>
<mark>
St Jerome</mark>
You say that Mary did not remain a virgin. I, instead, claim to affirm something even more: namely, that Joseph also remained a virgin for Mary's sake, so that a virgin Son might be born from a virgin marriage. For if there was no place for fornication in a holy man like Joseph, and if it is not written that he had another wife, and if for Mary, who was considered his wife, he was a guardian rather than a husband, we conclude that, along with Mary, he who merited to be called father of the Lord remained a virgin.

<br>
<mark>
St Bonaventure</mark>
Let us go to the Virgin with great confidence, and we will tranquilly find her in our necessities. Therefore this tabernacle is rightly to be honored, and to this tabernacle flight should be made, in which the Lord rested so familiarly, so that the Blessed Virgin herself could say truly and literally, "Who made me rested in my tabernacle." (Fourth sermon on Annunciation, IX, 673).
<br>
<mark>
St Thomas Aquinas</mark>
She is endowed with this great privilege, that all sinners, all evil-doers who wholeheartedly hasten to her are saved...and all prayers which are poured forth to her are heard... Come, let us go confidently to this temple of grace, that we may find mercy.
