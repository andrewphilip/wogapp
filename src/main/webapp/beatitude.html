Blessed - All of the Beatitudes found in Matthew 5 and Luke 6 begin with the Greek word <mark>makarious</mark> .( ma-car'-e-os)
But Jesus did not speak Greek. He spoke Aramaic and the Aramaic-Hebrew equivalent of this Greek word is ashre. We know this for certain because in Matthew 5:5 ("Blessed are the meek") Jesus quotes from Psalm 37:11 where the Hebrew is ashre. Why does this matter? Because there is another Hebrew word for "blessing" - <mark>barak.</mark> But barak is the blessing we receive from God, granted by His sovereign decision, independent of anything we do. Ashre is a blessing that comes through our own action.
The word beatitude comes from the Latin beatus meaning happy or blissful, an adjective representing the Hebrew ashre and the Greek makarious.

 The Beatitudes are at the heart of Jesus' preaching. They take up the promises made to the chosen people since Abraham. The Beatitudes fulfill the promises by ordering them no longer merely to the possession of a territory, but to the Kingdom of heaven:
The Beatitudes respond to the natural desire for happiness. This desire is of divine origin: God has placed it in the human heart in order to draw man to the One who alone can fulfill it:
We all want to live happily; in the whole human race there is no one who does not assent to this proposition, even before it is fully articulated.
How is it, then, that I seek you, Lord? Since in seeking you, my God, I seek a happy life, let me seek you so that my soul may live, for my body draws life from my soul and my soul draws life from you.
God alone satisfies.
<br>
The Beatitudes reveal the goal of human existence, the ultimate end of human acts: God calls us to his own beatitude. This vocation is addressed to each individual personally, but also to the Church as a whole, the new people made up of those who have accepted the promise and live from it in faith.
<br>

1.  The Beatitudes take up and fulfill God's promises from Abraham on by ordering them to the Kingdom of heaven. They respond to the desire for happiness that God has placed in the human heart.
<br>
2.   The Beatitudes teach us the final end to which God calls us: the Kingdom, the vision of God, participation in the divine nature, eternal life, filiation, rest in God.
<br>
3.   The beatitude of eternal life is a gratuitous gift of God. It is supernatural, as is the grace that leads us there.
<br>
4.    The Beatitudes confront us with decisive choices concerning earthly goods; they purify our hearts in order to teach us to love God above all things.
<br>
5.     The beatitude of heaven sets the standards for discernment in the use of earthly goods in keeping with the law of God.

There are three major theories that Bible scholars have developed to account for the differences between Matthew's Sermon on the Mount and Luke's Sermon on the Plain:
Both Gospels give accounts of the same discourse. 
The Gospels reflect two different homilies spoken at different times during Jesus' teaching ministry. 

The Gospels present two homilies delivered in close succession: one on the summit of the mountain to the disciples and then a second homily on the plain to the multitude. 
<br>

In Matthew's Gospel the message is a spiritual message composed of 7 blessings and resulting in 7 promises while in Luke Jesus is addressing 4 social justice issues which are followed by 4 curses directed against those who perpetuate the injustice.
<br>

In the Sermon on the Plain in Luke 6:20-26 Jesus gives His teaching in the Old Covenant style of Leviticus 26:3-46 and Deuteronomy 28:1-46.
Jesus promises to those who have suffered in this life:
  He promises the poor that they will inherit the Kingdom of Heaven
He promises the hungry that they will be filled  He promises the sorrowful that they will become joyful
          He promises those who are persecuted for following Him that they will be rewarded in  heaven just as the prophets of God will be rewarded
         He pronounces curses on the rich who allow poverty to increase without using the blessings of their material wealth to comfort the poor and suffering; the rich who do not share their wealth will only receive a temporal blessing but will remain spiritually impoverished, they will have no share in the eternal blessings promised in the heavenly kingdom:
They will have no "wealth" in eternity.
         They may be full now but they will be hungry for eternity.
They may experience joy now but they will suffer later in the life beyond this earthly existence.
They are compared to those who persecuted God's holy prophets.

<mark>St.  Augustine</mark> cannot help but notice a certain correlation between the sevenfold Beatitude and the sevenfold operation of the Holy Spirit in Isaiah 11:1-3, traditionally known as the 'gifts of the Spirit' in the Catholic tradition. Although he has to reverse the order of the latter to make them fit, Augustine sees the parallelism as follows:
<br>
            Poor in Spirit: Fear of God
<br>
            Meekness: Piety
<br>
            Mourning: Knowledge
<br>
            Hunger and Thirst for Righteousness: Fortitude
<br>
            Merciful: Counsel
<br>
            Pure in Heart: Understanding
<br>
            Peacemakers: Wisdom
<br>

It is essential for Augustine that the seven beatitudes, or seven gifts, do not correspond to seven disctinct rewards, but rather, constitute one reward. Thus, he says, it is 'the one reward, which is the kingdom of heaven, [which] is variously named according to these stages'. This same regal reward is titled diversely: 'an inheritance', 'comfort', 'a full supply', 'mercy', 'the sight of God', and 'divine sonship'. All, in the end, amount to the same thing, the eternal possession of God Himself.
