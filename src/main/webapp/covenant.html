							St. Irenaeus, who was the bishop of Lyon in late second-century , said that to understand "the divine program and economy for the salvation of humanity" we have to understand God's "several covenants with humanity" and also "the special character of each covenant."
							
							The word "testament" (Latin = testamentus, Greek diatheke, and Hebrew = berit) means "covenant" or oath.
							
							Covenant comes from the Latin word, convenire ("to come together" or "to agree").
							
							Some scholars distinguish between "contract" (an exchange of goods and services) and "covenant" (an exchange of persons; for example in a marriage, or when Israel is called God's "firstborn son" in Exod 4:22)
							
							
							The Bible is God's written revelation of Himself and man's relationship to Him through the Covenant bond He establishes with those men and women He calls into a unique relationship. This is the theme of the Bible from Genesis to Revelation-- God's Covenant relationship with His people. Throughout salvation history obedience to God's Covenant yielded blessings but disobedience called down Covenant curses; for example the Covenant blessings and curses of the Sinai Covenant with the Old Israel.  In the Old Testament God's relationship with Israel was always defined in terms of the Covenant, the marriage bond by which He joined her to Himself as His chosen people.  While covenant blessings and curses in the Old Testament were temporal, covenant blessings and curses in the New Covenant in Christ are eternal and the covenant bond is expresses as a marriage bond between Jesus the Bridegroom and the New Israel, the Catholic [universal] Church as His Bride.

							<p class="small">Following St. Irenaeus, we're now ready to look at the number of covenants that God makes in the Bible and the special character of each. God makes six major covenants in the Bible, with:
							<br>
1. Adam and Eve (Genesis 1:26-2:3)<br>
2. Noah and his family (Genesis 9:8-17)<br>
3. Abraham and his descendants (Genesis 12:1-3; 17:1-14; 22:16-18)<br>
4. Moses and the Israelites (Exodus 19:5-6; 3:4-10; 6:7)<br>
5. David and the Kingdom of Israel (2 Samuel 7:8-19)<br>
6. Jesus and the Church (Matthew 26:28; 16:17-19)<br>
It's important to know these covenants well - what God promises and what is required of those who enter into the covenants.
Notice the 4 things similar in these covenants - A blessing, a condition/curse, a sign, and the resultant form of God's family.

							<mark>Sixth is the Covenant promised through Jeremiah, fulfilled by Jesus:</mark>
							
							
							Jeremiah 31:31-34: "Behold, the days are coming, says the LORD, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and the house of Judah, not like the covenant which I made with their fathers when I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt, my covenant which they broke, though I was their husband, says the LORD. But this is the covenant which I will make with the house of Israel after those days, says the LORD: I will put my law within them, and I will write it upon their hearts; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people. And no longer shall each man teach his neighbor and each his brother, saying, `Know the LORD,' for they shall all know me, from the least of them to the greatest, says the LORD; for I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more."
							
							
							Blessing - God's Law will be written on our hearts. Believers become the new chosen people.
							Condition/Curse - Belief in Jesus as the son of God, Baptism, eating His Flesh and drinking His blood at Communion, and living as Christians, not pagans.
							Sign - The Eucharist
							Family Form - A universal worldwide Kingdom, or His Church
							</p>
							<p class="small">
							
							Notice how the family form progressed with each of God's six covenants - Man and wife, family, tribe, nation, kingdom, universal worldwide kingdom. What God is doing here is not only building up man's relationship to Him using signs and other humans, he is revealing more and more of Himself to us with each and every covenant, until at last He has revealed Himself fully in Jesus Christ. Sadly, man broke each covenant and had to endure the curses associated with each one. But God has been true to each one of His covenants with us, and that is really good news for us all.

							<mark>Pope Benedict XVI's Theology of Covenant</mark>
							
							
							In the biblical conception, a covenant is not a contract or mutual agreement between God and man, but an unsought gift of God to man. "The covenant then is not a pact built on reciprocity, but rather a gift, a creative act of God's love."In their concrete historical realizations, the covenants of God take multiple forms. The Apostle Paul uses "covenants" in the plural to describe God's dealings with Israel (cf. Rom. 9:4). In particular, that the Old Testament distinguishes the Noahite, Abrahamic, Mosaic and Davidic covenants.
							
							For St. Paul, the most important of these covenants are the Abrahamic and the Mosaic, which relate to the new covenant in different ways. While all the covenants enter into human history, the Abrahamic and new covenants share in a divinely guaranteed permanence, in contrast to the "transitory" and "provisional" nature of the Mosaic covenant. Whereas the Abrahamic covenant is "fundamental and enduring," the Mosaic covenant is "intervening" (Rom. 5:20). The Mosaic Law was a form of divine pedagogy designed to "fall away once the pedagogical goal has been achieved," and the goal of the Law is none other than Christ himself (cf. Rom. 10:4). Hence, the Mosaic covenant is a transitory "stage in the decrees of God, which has its own time. All this Paul has brought out clearly, and no Christian can revoke it."
							
							The establishment of the new covenant is described by the words of institution spoken by Jesus over the cup during the Last Supper. In the Gospels of Mark and Matthew, Jesus says, "This is my blood of the covenant" (Mark 14:24), which echoes the institution of the Mosaic covenant in Exodus 24:8. A covenantal ritual of this kind establishes a blood-union or kinship between its participants. Through the covenant, God establishes a "mysterious consanguinity" between himself and man.
							
							
							By declaring the cup to be the "blood of the covenant," Jesus is stating that his blood, poured out in his Passion and made really present in the Eucharist, will reestablish the bond of kinship between God and man. In this way, "the words of Sinai are intensified to an overwhelming realism." The Last Supper was fundamentally the "sealing of the covenant," and the Eucharist is now "an ongoing reenactment of this covenant renewal." The Letter to the Hebrews describes the institution of the Eucharist, in which the blood of Jesus is really offered to the Father, as "a cosmic Day of Atonement" (cf. Heb. 9:11-14, 24-26).In sacramental communion, the disciple is united both physically and spiritually with Christ (cf. 1 Cor. 6:16).
