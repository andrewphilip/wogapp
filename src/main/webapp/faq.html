          <h4 class="modal-title">Why catholics pray the Hail Mary?</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="modal-body">
          <p>
We don't pray to her ; we ask her to pray  for us. 
<br>

Pope John Paul II explains why we pray the Hail Mary  in his apostolic  letter  Rosarium Virginis Mariae (RVM).
<br>

For John Paul II, the Hail Mary is not just an intercessory prayer that is permissible for Christians to recite; it's actually a Christ-centered prayer that gives Jesus great praise. If we truly love Jesus, we as Christians should want to pray this prayer!
<br>

In this short article, we will consider John Paul II's reflections on the Hail Mary and how they can transform the way we pray this prayer and lead us to deeper intimacy with Jesus each time we recite it.
<br>

Put Yourself in Gabriel's Shoes
<br>

First, John Paul II explains that although the Hail Mary is addressed to Our Lady, "it is to Jesus that the act of love is ultimately directed" (RVM, no. 26). When expounding on this prayer, he divides the Hail Mary into two halves. In an amazing statement, John Paul II notes how the words from the first half of the Hail Mary express "the wonder of heaven and earth" over the mystery of Christ in the womb of the Virgin Mary (RVM, no. 33).
<br>

Let's consider what he means about "the wonder of heaven and earth" in the Hail Mary. The first line -- "Hail, Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee" -- is drawn right from the angel Gabriel's words to Our Lady in the Annunciation scene (Lk. 1:28). to more fully appreciate the meaning of this opening line in the Hail Mary, imagine what these words originally meant to the Archangel Gabriel. 
Gabriel is an angel who existed long before Mary did. Gabriel has been around a lot longer than the nation of Israel or the entire human family. In fact, Gabriel was there when God first created the world. From the beginning of his existence, Gabriel has been worshipping, adoring, and loving the infinite, almighty God, the Creator: the Blessed Trinity.
<br>

And now, this great angel is sent to a little planet in the universe called earth . . . to a small, insignificant village called Nazareth . . . to a tiny little creature, a woman named Mary -- in order to announce to her that the all-holy, all-powerful God he has been worshipping from the beginning of his existence is about to become a little baby in her womb. In awe over that profound mystery of his eternal God becoming a little embryo in Mary's womb, Gabriel greets Mary saying, "Hail, full of grace, the Lord is with you" (Lk. 1:28). Indeed, the Lord has not been with anyone like He is about to be with Mary. In joyful wonder, Gabriel recognizes this, and his words give praise to God for becoming man in her.
<br>

Joining Heaven and Earth
<br>

Similarly, Elizabeth greets Mary with great honor. The biblical account of the Visitation tells us that Elizabeth was "filled with the Holy Spirit" (Lk. 1:41), which indicates that she was given prophetic insight. Before Mary has a chance to say anything about her own pregnancy, Elizabeth already knows. And she knows Mary is pregnant not with any ordinary child, but with the Lord Himself. In wonder over this mystery of God becoming man in Mary, Elizabeth exclaims,
"blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb!" like Gabriel, Elizabeth's words give praise to God for the Incarnation.
<br>

Do you realize that every time you recite the Hail Mary, you are repeating these famous words of Gabriel and Elizabeth? And in doing so, you enter into the ecstatic joy of "heaven and earth" over the mystery of Christ: heaven, represented by Gabriel, and earth, represented by Elizabeth.
Both come together to praise God for becoming man in Jesus Christ, the child conceived in Mary's womb. And we join in that praise of God every time we pray the Hail Mary.
Indeed, the Hail Mary is truly a Christ-centered prayer!
<br>

God's Own Wonderment
<br>

Furthermore, since these words of Gabriel and Elizabeth are from the inspired Word of God in Scripture, they also represent God's own response to the mystery of the Christ. Hence, whenever we repeat these words in the Hail Mary, we participate in God's joy over the Incarnation. As John Paul II explains, "These words . . . could be said to give us a glimpse of God's own wonderment as he 
contemplates his 'masterpiece' -- the Incarnation of the Son in the womb of the Virgin Mary. . . . The repetition of the Hail Mary . . . gives us a share in God's own wonder and pleasure: In jubilant amazement we acknowledge the greatest miracle of history" (RVM, no. 33).
<br>

The second half of the Hail Mary also is focused on Jesus. Here, we entrust our lives to Mary's intercession, asking her to "pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death."
<br>

As a model disciple of Christ, who said "yes" to God's will all throughout her life -- from the time when Gabriel first appeared to her all the way to the Cross -- Mary is the ideal person to be interceding for us through the many trials and struggles we face in our lives. We ask her to pray for us, so that we may follow God faithfully like she did. As the Catechism of the Catholic Church teaches, "She prays for us as she prayed for herself: 'let it be to me according to your word.' 
by entrusting ourselves to her prayer, we abandon ourselves to the will of God together with her: 'Thy will be done'" (no. 2677).
<br>

The Language of Love
<br>
Finally, we see just how Christ-centered the Hail Mary is when we come to what John Paul II calls "the hinge" of this prayer: the holy name of Jesus. Not only is the name of Jesus the hinge that binds the two halves together, but it is truly meant to be the "center of gravity" of the entire Hail Mary.
This should encourage us to examine how we pray the Hail Mary: Is Jesus' name truly "the center of gravity" of our prayer? Do we treat the name of Jesus with extra care and speak His name with love when we recite the Hail Mary?
<br>

John Paul II notes how emphasis should be given to the name of Jesus in this prayer. However, if we pray the Hail Mary too quickly, we may not give the proper reverence and loving attention to Jesus' name that we should. "Sometimes, in hurried recitation, this centre of gravity can be overlooked" (RVM, no. 33). A friend of mine says we should treat the name of Jesus 
in the Hail Mary like a speed bump -- something for which we slow down and pay extra attention when we come to it.
<br>

Another analogy might be taken from the language of love. Lke a lover tenderly speaking the name of one's beloved, we should speak the name of Jesus in this prayer. Indeed, with each Hail Mary, we should affectionately repeat the name of our bridegroom -- "blessed is the fruit of thy womb . . . Jesus" -- so that the holy name of Jesus, spoken with tender love, truly becomes the heartbeat of every Hail Mary we pray.

          <h4 class="modal-title">Why do Catholics Confess their Sins to a Priest?</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="modal-body">
          <p>
Catholics confess their sins to priests because as it is clearly stated in Sacred Scripture - God in the Person of Jesus Christ authorized the priests of His church to hear confessions and empowered them to forgive sins in His Name. To the Apostles, the first priests of His Church, Christ said: "Peace be with you. As the Father has sent me, even so I send you." And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and said to them, "Receive the Holy Spirit. If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven; if you retain the sins of any, they are retained." (John 20:21-23) Then again: "Truly, I say to you, whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven." (Matthew 18:18) Catholics confess their sins to priests because priests are God's duly authorized agents in the world, representing Him in all matters pertaining to the ways and means of attaining eternal salvation. When Catholics confess their sins to a priest they are, in reality, confessing their sins to God, for God hears their confessions and it is He who, in the final analysis, does the forgiving. If their confessions are not sincere, their sins are not forgiven.

          <h4 class="modal-title">Is the Eucharist a true sacrifice?</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="modal-body">
          <p>
The celebration of the Eucharist stands at the center of the Church's life and is expressed in its deepest mystery in the Mass of the Holy Catholic Church.  The Church has always taught, down through the centuries, that the celebration of Holy Eucharist is a true and holy sacrifice to God.  In their writings the disciples of the Apostles, the apostolic "Fathers of the Church", testified to this truth, and when this belief came under attack during the Protestant Reformation of the 16th century AD the Council of Trent affirmed the teaching of the Eucharist as the true and perfect sacrifice of the Lamb of God for the sins of mankind.  The Council proclaimed that the sacrifice of Christ at Calvary and the sacrifice of the Eucharist are one single sacrifice with the "substance" of Christ being the same but with the "manner" of the offering of Christ being different: "The victim is one and the same [...] who then offered himself on the cross; only the manner of offering is different. [..] In this divine sacrifice which is celebrated in the Mass, the same Christ who offered himself once in a bloody manner on the altar of the cross is contained and is offered in an unbloody manner." [Council of Trent (1562) DS 1743].
<br>
Those who do not believe in the re-presentation of Christ's sacrifice in the Eucharist argue that another sacrifice would detract from the unique sacrifice of Christ that was offered on the cross at Calvary.  Their point is that Jesus' sacrifice was complete and sufficient so why would we need an additional sacrifice if Jesus Christ is "the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world" [John 1:29]?  Isn't saying that the Eucharist is a real sacrifice saying that Jesus' sacrifice on the cross wasn't enough?  But the Church has always agreed that Jesus' sacrifice was sufficient and complete, never to be repeated.  His sacrifice on the cross was the full and complete sacrifice to which every Old Covenant animal of sacrifice prefigured as St. John announced in the Gospel of John 1:29 and 36: The next day, he saw Jesus coming towards him and said, "Look, there is the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world and Jesus went past and John looked towards him and said, "Look, there is the Lamb of God."
<br>

Under the Old Covenant the only means of atoning for the sins of believers was through the sacrifice of animals: For the life of the creature is in the blood, and I have given it to you for performing the rite of expiation on the altar for you lives, for blood is what expiates for a life [Leviticus 17:11].   In fact, all over the world throughout the dark ages of humanity the blood of animals [and occasionally humans] as a sacrifice has been a practice of mankind in the essence of religious worship.  But no animal, no ordinary human being, for that matter, could be a perfect enough sacrifice to fully atone for the sins of man.  Those imperfect sacrifices had to be offered repeatedly.  As the inspired author of the New Testament Book of Hebrews writes Every priest stands at his duties every day, offering over and over again the same sacrifices which are quite incapable of taking away sins.  He [Christ] on the other hand, has offered one single sacrifice for sins, and then taken his seat for ever, at the right hand of God..  [Hebrews 10:11-12]. It was God's plan for the redemption of man that Jesus' sacrifice on the cross " completes and surpasses all the sacrifices of the Old Covenant." [#1330 Catechism of the Catholic Church].
<br>

This is the crucial difference between the sacrifices of the Old Covenant and the New Covenant sacrifice of Jesus the Messiah.  The sacrifice at Cavalry was the definitive sacrifice of Jesus Christ, our high priest, who offered the final, true sacrifice that alone could make atonement for the sins of man.  The Catechism of the Catholic Church affirms this teaching in # 1364: In the New Testament, the memorial takes on new meaning.  When the Church celebrates the Eucharist, she commemorates Christ's Passover, and it is made present: the sacrifice Christ offered once for all on the cross remains ever present.  As often as the sacrifice of the cross by which "Christ our Pasch has been sacrificed" is celebrated on the altar, the work of our redemption is carried out. And in #1365 the Catechism also teaches that because it is the memorial of Christ's Passover, the Eucharist is also a sacrifice....  That is why we say that the Eucharist is the very same sacrifice as the sacrifice Jesus' presented on the cross.  However, each and every Mass is not a "new" sacrifice of Christ; it is instead the on-going sacrifice of the one perfect sacrifice that was offered by Jesus almost 2,000 years ago, the sacrifice of Christ on the cross and the sacrifice of the Eucharist are one single sacrifice [CCC#1367]. But, didn't He redeem us by His death on the cross?  Yes, redemption was accomplished at the cross but the application of His redemption goes on [CCC#1366].  When Jesus died on the cross salvation was offered to all mankind, but not all mankind will accept that gift of salvation.  The death of Jesus must be applied to each individual person by faith down through time, across nations and generations.
<br>

It is the application of His sacrificial death that must be carried out in the world through time if all men are to receive the possibility of that precious gift of salvation.  The sacrifice of the Eucharist is the principal means, established by God, for the application of forgiveness to take place. Just as we repeat what Jesus did in the Upper Room in obedience to His command, "Do this in memory of me"; it is in the Last Supper of the Eucharist that we unite with Him in the sacrifice which began that night when He separated His body from His blood in the sacrificial meal of the Old Covenant Passover supper in the Feast of Unleavened Bread.   Jesus doesn't die again but His death is present again and again in the celebration of the Eucharist.  If the Church was claiming that Jesus dies again in the Mass then the sacrifice would have to be a "bloody" sacrifice because "without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness" [Hebrews 9:22].  But the sacrifice of the Eucharist is instead an unbloody sacrifice of the glorified Christ who continues to offer Himself for the sins of mankind.  This is the sacrifice St. John witnessed in the book of Revelation, the last book of the New Testament.  It is on a Sunday, "the Lord's Day"  [Revelation 1:10] when in St. John's vision he sees Jesus the "Lamb of God", standing before God's throne offering Himself as the perfect sacrifice: "Then, between the throne with the four living creatures and the elders, I saw a Lamb standing, a Lamb that had been slain." [Revelation 5:6].  John's vision occurred years after Calvary, anywhere from 38-50 years after Christ's resurrection!  John's vision presents Christ in heaven standing before the throne of God as both the victim and the High Priest of the New Covenant people of God, offering His glorified body and blood to God the Father in an on-going sacrifice for our sins [see Hebrews 9:12-14 and 10:19].  His on-going, perpetual sacrifice before the Father becomes present in the Holy Eucharist of the Mass through the miracle of the Holy Spirit.  The Church has given the word "transubstantiation" to this miracle when our gifts of bread and wine are miraculously transformed into the very Body, Blood, Soul, and Divinity of the risen Savior.  The word "transubstantiation" is our feeble and inarticulate attempt to explain the profound mystery of Christ's real presence on the altar in what only continues to have the appearance of bread and wine but which, through the power of the Holy Spirit, has become what Jesus promised in the Gospel of John 6:55 For my flesh is real food and my blood is real drink.  Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood lives in me and I live in that person.   And finally, the sacrifice of Most Holy Eucharist is also the sacrifice of the Church as the Body of Christ in which the Church unites herself to Christ's intercession with the Father for all mankind: "In the Eucharist the sacrifice of Christ becomes also the sacrifice of the members of His Body" [CCC#1368].  It is Jesus' sacrifice present on the altar that makes it possible for all generations of believers to be united with His offering of Himself for our salvation and for the salvation of the whole world.
<br>

Christ died only once to forgive sins and His sacrificial death was fully accomplished on the cross, but God has given the gift of the Eucharist as the tangible means of applying His Son's forgiveness.  Christ's forgiveness is applied through the Eucharist because the substance of the Eucharist is Jesus Christ and everyone one must have that substance to receive the gift of eternal life. Jesus established the Eucharistic meal for that very reason-to apply healing and forgiveness to those who in faith receive Him in the Eucharist. The bread and wine are transformed just as the bread and wine were transformed in the hands of Jesus at the Last Supper to become all of Christ: Body, Blood, Soul, and Divinity.  It is the amazing gift of God to His children on their journey to the Promised Land that the sacrifice of Christ at Calvary is present in the Eucharist, the bread from heaven He promised us in John 6:34, 47-58, and it is through His healing power of the Bread of Life that we who unite ourselves to His sacrifice are all transformed and made One with Him.

          <h4 class="modal-title">Aren't all those statues in the Catholic Church the same as worshipping graven images?</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="modal-body">
          <p>
First, one must understand what a graven image is in the context of the Old Testament. To make a graven image is to create an image out of some medium, such as clay or wood, and worship it as a God. The statues or pictures of Mary are not worshipped as a God. If a Catholic worships a statue of Mary as a God, they are guilty of idolatry.
<br>
The Lord did not forbid the making of images. In fact, God commanded Moses to shape a brazen serpent. This serpent was able to cure the people of the serpent bite, if they looked upon it (Numbers 21:8). Later, when the people turned to idolatry of the serpent, Hezekiah had it destroyed (II Kings 18:4). Here you see the balance. Images are good, if they are helpful, but not if they encourage idolatry.
<br>

Moreover, the Lord commanded that the image of two Cherubim be constructed on the top of the Ark of the Covenant on either side of the Mercy seat. Was this the sin of idolatry? I think not.
<br>

Mary is the mother of God and the saints are the friends of God. If keeping their pictures or statues helps to inspire us to a more holy life, then it is a good thing. Don't you have pictures of your family in your home? Is this idolatry? Or when someone dies, should you destroy all images or pictures of them, lest you be guilty of worshipping them?
