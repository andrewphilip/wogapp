Eucharist  is derived from  the Greek word  eucharistia (which means  thanksgiving). In the old testament , todah (which means thanksgiving ) is a peace offering  under the Mosaic Covenant.

<blockquote>
The Eucharist is "the source and summit of the Christian life."The other sacraments, and indeed all ecclesiastical ministries and works of the apostolate, are bound up with the Eucharist and are oriented toward it. For in the blessed Eucharist is contained the whole spiritual good of the Church, namely Christ himself, our Pasch."

The sacrifice of Christ and the sacrifice of the Eucharist are one single sacrifice: "The victim is one and the same: the same now offers through the ministry of priests, who then offered himself on the cross; only the manner of offering is different." "And since in this divine sacrifice which is celebrated in the Mass, the same Christ who offered himself once in a bloody manner on the altar of the cross is contained and is offered in an unbloody manner. . . this sacrifice is truly propitiatory."

<mark>Sacrament of the Eucharist: threefold significance</mark>
This is what an interpretation of the whole of salvation history considers the most splendid of  St. Thomas Aquinas affirmations: "A sacrament is a sign that is both a reminder of the past, that is, the Passion of Christ; and an indication of that which is effected in us by Christ's Passion, that is, grace; and a prognostic (precognosticum), that is, a foretelling (praenuntiativum) of future glory" (Summa, III, 60, 3, c.).

 "This sacrament has a threefold significance: one with regard to the past, inasmuch as it is commemorative of our Lord's Passion, which was a true sacrifice, as stated above, and in this respect it is called a Sacrifice.
<br>
"With regard to the present it has another meaning, namely, that of ecclesiastical unity, in which men are aggregated through this sacrament; and in this respect it is called Communion....
<br>
"With regard to the future it has a third meaning, inasmuch as this sacrament foreshadows the Divine fruition which shall come to pass in heaven; and according to this it is called Viaticum, because it supplies the way of winning thither" (Summa, III, 73, 4, c.).
<br>
We find the Christian event fully present in the Eucharist, which is also the perfect initiation to it. The fact that in the treatment of the sacraments the Holy Eucharist follows Baptism and Confirmation does not prevent it from being "the sacrament" par excellence, the "summit" or "completion of the sacraments" and the one to which all the other sacraments relate.
The Eucharist is, as it were, "the consummation of the spiritual life, and the end of all the sacraments" (Summa, III, 73, 3, c.).

The reason for this, St Thomas explains, lies in the fact that whereas the energy - "vis" or "virtus" - of the Passion of Christ is active in the other sacraments, the Eucharist contains "Christ's own Body" (Summa, III, 73, 1, 3m); in Scholastic language, Christ is present as "the common spiritual good of the whole Church... contained substantially in the sacrament itself of the Eucharist" (Summa, III, 65, 3, 1), in order to bring man to full communion with Christ in the Passion (cf. Summa, III, 73, 2, 3m).
<br>
<mark>Todah foreshadowed Eucharist</mark>
Under the Mosaic covenant, there were many sacrifices and, indeed, many types of sacrifice.
In the new covenant, there is one sacrifice, that of Christ himself. The many sacrifices are "reduced" to the one, in the etymological sense (Latin "re-ducere") of being "led back" to Christ, so as to find their unity and true meaning. This "reduction" is the theme of Hebrews 10:1-18. In the center of that passage, the author cites the words of Psalm 40:6-8, applying them to Christ.
<br>
Consequently, when Christ came into the world, he said, "Sacrifices and offerings you have not desired, but a body have you prepared for me; in burnt offerings and sin offerings you have taken no pleasure. Then I said, 'Behold, I have come to do your will, O God, as it is written of me in the scroll of the book.'" (Heb. 10:5-7)

The multiple types of sacrifice in the Mosaic covenant are detailed in Leviticus 1-7. These offerings can be divided and subdivided in various ways, but the major categories are the burnt offerings, the cereal offerings, the peace offerings, the sin offerings, and the guilt offerings. Peace offerings included the eating of a sacrificial meal and, indeed, were the only sacrifices in which non-priests were permitted to share in the meal. An important subcategory of the peace offering was the todah offering, described in Leviticus 7:12-15.

With the sacrifice of his peace offerings for thanksgiving he shall bring his offering with loaves of leavened bread. And from it he shall offer one loaf from each offering, as a gift to the LORD. It shall belong to the priest who throws the blood of the peace offerings. And the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings for thanksgiving shall be eaten on the day of his offering. He shall not leave any of it until the morning. (Lev. 7:13-15)
<br>
Todah literally means "thanksgiving." In addition to the sense of thanksgiving or gratitude, it also has a strong connotation of praise. The todah offering was accompanied by an associated type of song, usually a psalm.
The todah sacrifice was offered by a person whose life had been redeemed or delivered from a great danger.
The person who had been delivered would express his gratitude to God by celebrating a sacrificial meal with family and friends. A priest would normally sacrifice a lamb and consecrate bread in the temple. The meat and bread would then be brought home for the meal, along with wine.
The meal would then be accompanied by songs of thanksgiving. Todah songs have a characteristic movement from lament to praise. Sometimes, the song is actually structured with two halves, the first a lament, the second a praise. The lament recounts the circumstance of impending death and the prayer to God for deliverance. The praise recalls and proclaims the deliverance from death, for which God is thanked and praised.

The crucial point is that todah presupposes a narrative, an account of what has happened in the life of the one giving thanks. One does not simply give thanks in a generic or abstract way. One gives thanks for a particular deliverance from suffering or mortal danger.
<br>	
Isaiah 38 gives us an important example of a todah song because we have its corresponding narrative context. King Hezekiah fell deathly ill in the midst of the siege of Jerusalem by King Sennacherib of Assyria (Is. 38:1). Hezekiah prayed to the Lord and begged for deliverance (Is. 38:2-3). He then received the word of the Lord from the prophet Isaiah promising both personal deliverance from the illness and the deliverance of Jerusalem from the Assyrians (Is. 38:4-6). In response, Hezekiah composed a todah song (Is. 38:9-20) to accompany his offering in the temple (Is. 38:22). The content and structure of the song reflect the todah pattern of lament followed by praise. In the song (Is. 38:10-20), Hezekiah recalls his lament for impending death (Is. 38:10-11) and plea for deliverance (Is. 38:16), followed by his proclamation of consequent deliverance (Is. 38:17), thanksgiving and praise (Is. 38:19-20).
<br>
1 Chronicles 16 of David's organization of the liturgical services after the Ark of the Covenant was brought to Jerusalem. At that time, David appointed the Levitical clan of Asaph "to thank and praise the Lord" (1 Chron. 16:6) and to "sing thanksgiving before the Lord" (1 Chron. 16:7). Two todah psalms (Ps. 105 and 96) are then quoted at length within the text as examples. The account then states that the service of thanksgiving was to be performed by the clan of Asaph on a continuing basis (1 Chron. 16:37).
<br>
The narrative parallels with Psalm 22 in the synoptic accounts of the Passion of Christ are well-known (e.g., Mt. 27:35, 39, 43). John, for his part, explicitly cites the casting of lots for Christ's garments as a fulfillment of the Psalm (Jn. 19:24). Most striking is Christ's invocation, noted above, of the first verse of the Psalm while on the Cross (Mt. 27:46). Using the words of the psalmist, Christ laments his suffering and cries out for deliverance: not from death but through death. By quoting the first verse of a canonical psalm, Christ brings to mind the psalm as a whole. The holistic use of the psalm in confirmed by the evangelists' references to multiple parts of the psalm in the Passion narratives.

The significance of such holistic use of the psalm lies in the fact that a todah psalm does not stop at lament and deliverance but moves to proclamation. The proclamation of Psalm 22 points to the Resurrection as the greatest possible deliverance, one that will culminate in the evangelization of Israel and the nations. Though it is left implicit in the Passion narratives, the second half of the psalm is no less applicable than the first half, showing that the fruit of the Resurrection is the ever-widening proclamation of the good news of the kingdom of God.
The Passover sacrifice and the todah sacrifice were both peace offerings and, as such, shared the features common to that category. However, they also possessed elements in common that differentiated them from other peace offerings. For example, they both employed unleavened bread (Ex. 12:8; Lev. 7:12) and had to be eaten entirely on the same day that they were offered (Ex. 12:10; Lev. 7:15).
<br>
The chief difference between the Passover and todah sacrifice was that the latter was celebrated at the initiative of an individual, whereas the former was mandated to be celebrated annually on the same day throughout Israel.
<br>
Passover strongly emphasizes the todah elements of remembrance and thanksgiving.
"This day shall be for you a memorial day, and you shall keep it as a feast to the LORD; throughout your generations, as a statute forever, you shall keep it as a feast." (Ex. 12:14)
Then Moses said to the people, "Remember this day in which you came out from Egypt, out of the house of slavery, for by a strong hand the LORD brought you out from this place. No leavened bread shall be eaten." (Ex. 13:3)


<mark>
The Eucharist as Todah
</mark>
The synoptic Gospels clearly affirm that the Last Supper took place during a celebration of Passover (e.g., Lk. 22:1415). One element of continuity between Passover and the Eucharist lies in their connection with todah sacrifice. Christ reconfigured the Passover meal around his own self-sacrifice in a manner that more perfectly expressed its nature as todah. The very use of the Greek term eucharistia reflects the centrality of thanksgiving in this liturgical action. The words of institution of the Eucharist at the Last Supper emphasize the essential todah elements of thanksgiving and remembrance.
<br>
And he took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and gave it to them, saying, "This is my body, which is given for you. Do this in remembrance of me." (Lk. 22:19)
But what is the object of thanksgiving and remembrance? Christ tells us that it is his "body which is given for you." Once again, todah presupposes a narrative, and the narrative to which the todah of the Last Supper refers is the Passion, death, and Resurrection of Christ. As suggested by the New Testament use of Psalm 22, the Passion, death, and Resurrection exemplify the todah movement from lament to praise.
<br><mark>
The Eucharist as New Passover</mark>
The relation between the Eucharist and Passover is not limited to their common todah pattern. Rather, the Eucharist is itself a New Passover in which Christ serves as the paschal lamb whose body and blood effect redemption. Paul understands the Eucharist within this paschal framework.
Cleanse out the old leaven that you may be a new lump, as you really are unleavened. For Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed. Let us therefore celebrate the festival, not with the old leaven, the leaven of malice and evil, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth. (1 Cor. 5:7-8)
Just as Passover recalled and made present the Exodus from bondage in Egypt, the New Passover recalls and makes present the New Exodus from bondage to sin. By his paschal sacrifice, in which he was delivered from death to new life, the Messiah established the new covenant and redeemed the members of his body from sin. This deliverance brought about by the Messiah is the New Exodus.
Yet, the New Exodus is not chiefly external but has a profound spiritual dimension, for the root cause of exile is covenantal violation or sin. Throughout Isaiah 40-55, the New Exodus is closely associated with redemption from sin. Peter, just before quoting Isaiah 40, echoes the theme of redemption from sin while identifying Christ's paschal sacrifice as the source of redemption.

[Y]ou were ransomed from the futile ways inherited from your forefathers, not with perishable things such as silver or gold, but with the precious blood of Christ, like that of a lamb without blemish or spot. (1 Peter 1:18-19)
In short, the New Exodus is a set of closely related events within salvation history that includes the return of the 12 tribes and the salvation of the Gentiles in a restored kingdom through redemption from sin. Jesus asserts at the Last Supper that just this set of events was then underway.
[A]nd I assign to you, as my Father assigned to me, a kingdom, that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom and sit on thrones judging the 12 tribes of Israel. (Lk. 22:29-30)
<br>
Joseph Ratzinger (now Pope Benedict XVI) said , we can appreciate the eschatological significance of the doctrine of transubstantiation. The Eucharistic elements, fruit of the earth and the work of human hands, are not destroyed or annihilated through the power of Christ; rather, they are transfigured, elevated into vehicles for Christ's self-communication. In the letters of Paul, we find the mysterious observations that, at the culmination of the present age, Christ "will be all in all" and that all people will come together in forming "that perfect man who is Christ come to full stature.""

The <mark>Didache or "The Teaching of the Twelve Apostles" </mark> is a manuscript which was used by 2nd century bishops and priests for the instruction of catechumens.
"On the Lord's own day, assemble in common to break bread and offer thanks; but first confess your sins, so that your sacrifice may be pure. However, no one quarreling with his brother may join your meeting until they are reconciled; your sacrifice must not be defiled. For here we have the saying of the Lord: 'In every place and time offer me a pure sacrifice; for I am a mighty King, says the Lord; and my name spreads terror among the nations.'" -Ch 14

<mark>St. Ignatius</mark> became the third bishop of Antioch, succeeding St. Evodius, who was the immediate successor of St. Peter. He heard St. John preach when he was a boy and knew St. Polycarp, Bishop of Smyrna. In his letter to Romans, he said  the following:
<blockquote>"I have no taste for the food that perishes nor for the pleasures of this life. I want the Bread of God which is the Flesh of Christ, who was the seed of David; and for drink I desire His Blood which is love that cannot be destroyed."</blockquote>

<mark>St. Justin Martyr</mark> was born a pagan but converted to Christianity after studying philosophy. He  is one of the  greatest apologist or defender of the faith from the 2nd century. He was beheaded with six of his companions some time between 163 and 167 A.D.
<blockquote>"God has therefore announced in advance that all the sacrifices offered in His name, which Jesus Christ offered, that is, in the Eucharist of the Bread and of the Chalice, which are offered by us Christians in every part of the world, are pleasing to Him."

<mark>St. Irenaeus</mark> succeeded St. Pothinus to become the second bishop of Lyons in 177 A.D. Earlier in his life he studied under St. Polycarp. Considered, one of the greatest theologians of the 2nd century, St. Irenaeus is best known for refuting the Gnostic heresies.
<blockquote>[Christ] has declared the cup, a part of creation, to be his own Blood, from which he causes our blood to flow; and the bread, a part of creation, he has established as his own Body, from which he gives increase to our bodies."

<mark>St. Clement of Alexandria</mark> studied under Pantaenus. He later succeeded him as the director of the school of catechumens in Alexandria, Egypt around the year 200 A.D.,
<blockquote>"The Blood of the Lord, indeed, is twofold. There is His corporeal Blood, by which we are redeemed from corruption; and His spiritual Blood, that with which we are anointed. That is to say, to drink the Blood of Jesus is to share in His immortality. The strength of the Word is the Spirit just as the blood is the strength of the body. Similarly, as wine is blended with water, so is the Spirit with man. The one, the Watered Wine, nourishes in faith, while the other, the Spirit, leads us on to immortality. The union of both, however, - of the drink and of the Word, - is called the Eucharist, a praiseworthy and excellent gift. Those who partake of it in faith are sanctified in body and in soul. By the will of the Father, the divine mixture, man, is mystically united to the Spirit and to the Word.",

<mark>St. Ephraim</mark> was one of the great authors of the Syrian Church. Because of his beautiful writings, he is sometimes referred to as the 'lyre of the Holy Spirit'. He studied under James, Bishop of Nisbis. In 338 A.D. he aspired to the diaconate and remained a deacon for the remainder of his life.,
<blockquote>
"Our Lord Jesus took in His hands what in the beginning was only bread; and He blessed it, and signed it, and made it holy in the name of the Father and in the name of the Spirit; and He broke it and in His gracious kindness He distributed it to all His disciples one by one. He called the bread His living Body, and did Himself fill it with Himself and the Spirit.,
<br>
And extending His hand, He gave them the Bread which His right hand had made holy: 'Take, all of you eat of this; which My word has made holy. Do not now regard as bread that which I have given you; but take, eat this Bread, and do not scatter the crumbs; for what I have called My Body, that it is indeed. One particle from its crumbs is able to sanctify thousands and thousands, and is sufficient to afford life to those who eat of it. Take, eat, entertaining no doubt of faith, because this is My Body, and whoever eats it in belief eats in it Fire and Spirit. But if any doubter eat of it, for him it will be only bread. And whoever eats in belief the Bread made holy in My name, if he be pure, he will be preserved in his purity; and if he be a sinner, he will be forgiven.' But if anyone despise it or reject it or treat it with ignominy, it may be taken as certainty that he treats with ignominy the Son, who called it and actually made it to be His Body.",
